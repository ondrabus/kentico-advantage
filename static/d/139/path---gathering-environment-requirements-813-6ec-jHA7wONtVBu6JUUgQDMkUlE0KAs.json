Additionally, they knew to configure the system to be aware of the CDN, so that the links are added properly. This avoided a costly delay in the project's go-live as they would have needed to re-link assets on the site.

The organization had relatively limited bandwidth and the added request load from the un-optimized home page resulted in an outage not only for the website, but for the other mission critical services.<br>\nIf they considered the production environment's limitations, they could have avoided this issue by focusing more on the web site performance and considering to host this web site elsewhere.
